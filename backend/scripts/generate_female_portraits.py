Background: softly blurred training grounds. Natural afternoon light, professional headshot style.",

Background: blurred abandoned cottage. Overcast lighting emphasizing trauma, documentary portrait style.",

Background: blurred foggy graveyard. Diffused misty light, photojournalistic style showing every detail of age."
