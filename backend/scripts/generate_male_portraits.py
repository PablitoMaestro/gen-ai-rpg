Background: blurred sunny village marketplace. Natural golden hour lighting, 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field focusing on face.",

Background: softly blurred library interior. Rembrandt lighting on face, professional headshot style.",

Background: blurred misty forest. Moody dramatic lighting emphasizing weariness, cinematic portrait.",

Background: blurred crumbling stone wall. Overcast natural light, documentary style showing every wrinkle and age mark."
