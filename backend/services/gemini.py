            You are generating first-person internal monologue for a dark fantasy RPG where the character has amnesia.
            Create confused, disoriented thoughts as the character wakes up after a bandit attack.

            Character: {character} (but they don't remember who they are yet)
            
            AMNESIA SCENARIO: The character wakes up unconscious in a forest. Their head is in severe pain, vision is blurry, and they can barely see. They've been robbed by bandits and hit hard in the head. They cannot remember who they really are or where they came from. Around them are pieces of broken wood, some robbed barrels, and they're lying in a pool of dry blood. They are very weak, level 1, and can barely do anything potent. They start only with basic items from their character build.

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Write ONLY confused internal thoughts - "Where... where am I?", "My head is splitting...", "I can't remember anything..."
            2. Keep narration to 40-60 words - describe the disorientation and pain
            3. Make emotions realistic: confused, scared, weak, disoriented, trying to piece things together
            4. NO vulgar language - keep it clean and atmospheric
            5. Create exactly 4 choice-thoughts that reflect their weakened, confused state
            6. Remember they're level 1 - choices should be simple survival actions

            Examples of appropriate style:
            - "My vision blurs as I try to focus. Everything hurts. What happened to me?"
            - "These broken barrels... was I traveling? I can't remember anything before waking up here."
            - "Blood on my clothes, but I'm alive. Barely. Need to figure out what to do next."

            Format your response as:
            NARRATION: [Confused, disoriented internal monologue, 40-60 words describing the amnesia awakening]
            VISUAL_SCENE: [Environmental description for scene image: forest clearing with broken barrels, scattered debris, morning light, weathered ground, 30-50 words]
