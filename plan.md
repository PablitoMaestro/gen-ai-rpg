## Notes & Decisions
- **Backend API Complete**: All core API integrations finished with comprehensive testing
- **Current Focus**: Frontend character creation and game UI implementation
- **Architecture**: Backend provides production-ready API; frontend needs full implementation
- **Testing**: Backend has complete test suite; frontend E2E testing needed
- **Deployment Ready**: Backend can be deployed immediately; frontend in development
